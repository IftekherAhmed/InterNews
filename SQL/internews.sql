Of \r\ncourse, most of them are scared and stressed, and want to be reassured \r\nwhether the symptoms point to a virus infection.</p>\r\n<p>And that concern is perfectly natural. Which is why, to ease your \r\nmental burden, I want to point out some differences between an \r\nallergy/the common cold and Covid-19.</p>\r\n<p>First of all, lets start with the common cold. Anyone and everyone \r\ncan get a common cold. The symptoms are a runny nose with stuffy or \r\nblocked feeling, sneezing, watery eyes, a sore throat and sometimes a \r\nlow-grade fever with a sense of being unwell.</p>\r\n<p>The cough that we get with a cold is usually mild and has sputum with\r\n it. A cold usually lasts 7-10 days and goes away with or without \r\nmedication. The fever is low grade or absent in common colds. Simple \r\nparacetamols with antihistamines will cure it.</p>\r\n<p>In case of allergic rhinitis, the patient usually knows they have the\r\n allergies, yet they could forget that they had the same symptoms last \r\nyear too! Usually, allergy symptoms can include sneezing with a runny \r\nnose, watery eyes, an itchy throat, but rarely a cough. This happens \r\nwhen exposed to dust, or some smell, or foods. It may also be triggered \r\nby weather changes like rain, heat, or cold. Allergies do not cause a \r\nfever. </p>\r\n<p>Patients with allergic rhinitis should start their regular \r\nanti-allergic meds if they get an episode. This will help to reduce or \r\neven control the situation.</p>\r\n<p>If this is new to you, try taking simple antihistamines, which are \r\navailable over the counter or consult with your doctor over the phone.</p>\r\n<p>Some patients with asthma are also worried when they are getting \r\nattacks, but please do not panic. Start your usual inhaler and if \r\nnecessary, oral medications. For these patients, my advice is to keep \r\nyour medications on hand.</p>\r\n<p>Now, about Covid-19. According to the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO), the major symptoms are high fever, cough which is dry, and \r\nbreathlessness, which is mild at first but gets worse with passing time.\r\n The cough is a persistent one and nothing will come out— i.e. there \r\nwill be no sputum. Along with this, the patient will feel exhausted, \r\nlose appetite, and become weak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest study also says patient may develop loss of smell, \r\nexperience diarrhoea, and difficulty in breathing, when the infection \r\ngets worse.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a fever above 101 degrees for more than few days with \r\ncough and breathlessness, start taking paracetamol to control the fever.\r\n Isolate yourself to a room with attached bathroom facilities, and \r\nmaintain quarantine from other members of the house. If the symptoms \r\npersist and get worse, contact your doctor, who will then advise if you \r\nneed to get tested. The important thing to remember is that even if you \r\nhave Covid-19, most patients recover on their own. A very small \r\npercentage of infected patients need hospitalisation.</p>\r\n<p>A few weeks ago, travel history was very important, but now, as the \r\nspread is community wise, we just have to be extra careful with our \r\ncontacts and where we are going. Wearing masks is very important when we\r\n are around other people, along with social distancing and frequent \r\nhand-washing.</p>\r\n<p>Keep a sanitiser with you at all times if you need to be out of the \r\nhouse, to avoid cross contamination through various surfaces., even \r\nmoney.</p>', '', 'life,style', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 1, 1, '2020-08-16 10:41:44'),

Even though these trips were few and not too\r\n far, every time I stepped outside of the house a distinctly more dire \r\nsituation was observable. These snippets, when extrapolated, indicate to\r\n increasingly difficult times for many. Numerous people asking/demanding\r\n money desperately, visibly destitute yet shy alms seekers, and of \r\ncourse a smattering of goonish extorters, are all a large part of the \r\noutside landscape.</p>\r\n<p>As even large companies struggle with salary expenses, thousands of \r\nlittle businesses and service personnel who all depend on a steady flow \r\nof freelance work to stay afloat are even worse off, and are cutting \r\nexpenses.

The \r\nresolute dedication hundreds of people have displayed in extending a \r\nhelping hand is truly amazing.

If you are a <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</em> fan and followed all the <em>Avengers</em>\r\n movies, then you must have a few important plotlines stirred up in your\r\n mind before watching the fourth venture on the big screen. The first \r\nthing to recollect is that half of the universe is dead. The <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> ended in the most shocking and emotionally devastating moment in the history of <em>MCU</em>.\r\n After assembling the infinity gauntlet, Thanos accomplished his goal of\r\n wiping out half of life, believing that it is the only way of \r\nmaintaining the balance of the universe. So, obviously the <em>MCU</em> is going to be in a dire situation when the curtain rises on <em>Endgame</em>.\r\n Basically, we have to be prepared to look at sad faces when we see the \r\navengers in action this time. We also must recall that, Doctor Strange \r\nsaw it all coming. His character brought a lot of new and interesting \r\npowers to the <em>MCU </em>when he was introduced in 2016 in his solo movie. In the previous <em>Avengers</em>,\r\n he used his time stone to time travel and look into all possible \r\nprobabilities of their success for the upcoming war. He came up with \r\nonly one probability of them winning. So, he knew what was coming, and \r\nmaybe even his death was all part of a bigger plan. All of this \r\nemotional turmoil and banishment may have been necessary for the \r\nultimate victory. Now, we also must not forget about Hulk and Banner. \r\nAfter the biggest and greenest avenger had his fight with Thanos in the \r\nopening sequence, we see that Hulk refused to come out later in the \r\nmovie. The answer to what happened next between Hulk and Banner maybe \r\nfound in the <em>Endgame</em>. According to the trailer of <em>Endgame</em>,\r\n we see that Tony Stark is stranded in space. However, previously, we \r\nsaw that Nebula and Tony were the only ones on the planet, Titan, who \r\nwatched their friends’ demise into thin air. So, we should look forward \r\nto seeing how the relationship of those two different characters build \r\nup as they come together to find a solution to their deserted life, Many\r\n conspiracy theories and concepts to what might be the actual end has \r\nbeen in the news ever since the last movie. It is sad, that a widely \r\nhyped superhero venture is coming to its last chapter, but it surely \r\nleft its mark since its first <em>Avengers</em> movie. We bet fans will \r\nreminisce this for a long time, and some may even carry on telling \r\nstories about this to their grandchildren.</p>', '', 'The,End', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 2, '2020-07-26 14:54:18'),

She already knew \r\nshe was going to have twin boys. At 3:00am on Thursday, she experienced \r\npremature labour pain. She and her husband went to clinics in the area \r\nand everyone refused to admit her as she had fever. Using the internet, \r\nthey found the name of a clinic in Mirpur with its own ambulance \r\nservice. They availed themselves of the service and thought their \r\ntroubles were over.</p>\r\n<p>On reaching the clinic, they were told it could not admit her without\r\n a no-Covid certificate because of her fever. The two were advised to go\r\n to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. On reaching the DMCH emergency, they\r\n were told to go to the specialised Covid unit.  The couple justifiably \r\nfeared being infected and hence refused to go there and took refuge on \r\nthe footpath when our photojournalist Anis met them.</p>\r\n<p>By this time, her bleeding had started, and she had nowhere to go and\r\n none were helping them. She was desperate and delirious. Anis hailed an\r\n ambulance that happened to accidentally pass by and pleaded with the \r\ndriver to take Jhuma to some clinic on humanitarian grounds. The driver,\r\n having first refused, reluctantly agreed seeing the desperate condition\r\n Jhuma was in.</p>\r\n<p>The driver took them to clinics in other areas, and being \r\ncontinuously refused, the couple decided to seek refuge in the locality \r\nwhere they reside. One ramshackle clinic back in Gazipur agreed to admit\r\n her, on condition that they do not reveal its name or address, where \r\nshe gave birth to twins by a C-section at 12:40pm in the afternoon. As \r\nof yesterday, both the mother and the twins were well.</p>\r\n<p>The story ended happily.</p>\r\n<p>But it could, just as well, have not. Jhuma was in labour with twins \r\nwhich meant that something had to be done within a limited time and that\r\n she needed medical attention immediately. Each clinic that refused her \r\nliterally condemned her to a dangerous eventuality which could have \r\nproven to be fatal for her or her twins or both.</p>\r\n<p>How could the clinics and hospitals throw out a pregnant woman in \r\nlabour? A minimum examination would have revealed that she was in no \r\nposition to be shuttled from one clinic to another. At one stage, her \r\nbleeding had started, and even then she was shown the door. Except for \r\nfever, which can come from myriad reasons, including labour, Jhuma had \r\nno symptoms resembling those of Covid-19.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, we have been publishing many stories of patients being \r\nroutinely denied treatment for having fever, cough or respiratory \r\nissues. (See our story \"Victims of denial\", published yesterday, May 21,\r\n 2020). The requirement being demanded is a \"no-Covid\" certificate \r\nbefore admission.

It can be \r\nmentioned here that the testing kit from Gonoshasthaya Kendra could \r\nprovide the perfect solution if its claim proves to be correct. Yet, \r\nbureaucratic delay is holding its permission.

A fake email \r\nmay appear to have come from the organization you work in or the bank \r\nwhere you keep your money. For example, the email can be like \"Your ATM \r\ncard has been disabled, and you need to confirm your card number to \r\nre-activate it.\" Fake emails can contain malware that may able to hack \r\nyour whole system.

Amid \r\ncoronavirus outbreak, criminals pretend to be a hospital official who is\r\n with your sick relative and request for an emergency payment to start \r\nmedical treatment or hackers can ask to provide bank account or bKash \r\naccount details showing urgency.

In this way, it\'ll be\r\n harder to track or guess your password and to hack it. Remember to \r\nchange the passwords regularly and don\'t use one password for multiple \r\npurposes. Furthermore, it is always a great idea to use a virtual \r\nprivate network (VPN) whether you\'re in a home network or public.

(44, '35b598513b1288cd887d5a1147c9aa0f.jpg', '', 'Nationalism, Patriotism, Cosmopolitanism: Tagore’s Ambiguities and Paradoxes (Part II)', '', '2020_05_23_5ec89e005c62812', 12, '<p>Like nationalism, Tagore\'s perspectives on patriotism are also \r\ncharacterised by certain paradoxes and ambiguities; he was a fervid \r\npatriot, yet he openly denounced and deplored the sentiment of \r\npatriotism. We know that Tagore wrote many songs celebrating his native \r\nland and paying homage to its beauty and fecundity, of which, as \r\nmentioned earlier, two have become the national anthems of India and \r\nBangladesh. Yet he loathed being called a patriot and derided the \r\nconcept vehemently in many of his writings. For example, in a letter to \r\nAurobindo Mohan Bose, responding to some harsh comments on his view of \r\nnationalism by Abala Bose, wife of the celebrated scientist Sir Jagadish\r\n Chandra Bose, Tagore commented, \"Patriotism cannot be our final \r\nspiritual shelter; my refuge is humanity. I will not buy glass for the \r\nprice of diamonds, and I will never allow patriotism to triumph over \r\nhumanity as long as I live.\" In a letter to C.F. Andrews, with whom \r\nTagore had a friendship of, in Uma Das Gupta\'s phrase, \"largeness and \r\nfreedom,\" he further wrote, \"This is the ugliest side of patriotism. For\r\n in small minds, patriotism dissociates itself from the higher ideal of \r\nhumanity. It becomes the magnification of self, on a stupendous scale – \r\nmagnifying our vulgarity, cruelty, greed; dethroning God, to put up this\r\n bloated self in its place.\"</p>\r\n<p>So why this dichotomy in Tagore\'s sensibility? Why did he reject \r\nsomething that seemed at once an integral part of his imagination? There\r\n are various possibilities. First of all, Tagore saw nationalism and \r\npatriotism as inseparable twins; both had a cultish nature that \r\namplified the \"vulgarity, cruelty, [and] greed\" in people and sought to \r\nreplace humanity and God with a bloated sense of self and the nation. As\r\n pointed out by Aurobindo in a previous statement, patriotism was a sort\r\n of a \"religion,\" which, like religious orthodoxy, could engender, in \r\nTagore\'s own phrases, \"abnormal vanity,\" \"moral callousness\" and \"a \r\nspirit of persecution\" in its followers. In this context, Nussbaum\'s \r\nresponse to Richard Rorty\'s appeal to Americans not to \"disdain \r\npatriotism as a value\" seems pertinent. Comparing Nikhil\'s cosmopolitan \r\nworldview in <em>The Home and the World to Rorty\'s</em>, Nussbaum \r\nexplains, \"I believe, as do Tagore and his character Nikhil, that this \r\nemphasis on patriotic pride is both morally dangerous and, ultimately, \r\nsubversive of some of the worthy goals patriotism sets out to serve…. \r\nRichard Rorty\'s patriotism may be a way of bringing all Americans \r\ntogether; but patriotism is very close to jingoism, and I\'m afraid I \r\ndon\'t see in Rorty\'s argument any proposal for coping with this very \r\ndanger.\"</p>\r\n<p>It is perhaps because of this inherent danger in the sentiment of \r\npatriotism – that it could easily translate into jingoism and reveal \r\nitself either on the battlefields of Europe (as in the case of the two \r\nWorld Wars) or in the religious riots in South Asia (as it is happening \r\nright now in Delhi, instigated by Modi\'s ultra-Hindu-nativist-xenophobic\r\n nationalism, as I write this article for <em>The Daily Star</em>) – that Tagore remained ambivalent about the concept.</p>\r\n<p>Another possible explanation is that, to Tagore patriotism was a \r\npersonal experience that \"comes out of a quest.\" It was not a matter of \r\nfancy or whim, simply because one was born in a particular land. \"Those \r\nwho think that the country is theirs simply because they have been born \r\nin it are creatures besotted by external things of the world,\" Tagore \r\nstated. To make desh into <em>swadesh</em>, a country into one\'s own country, one had to apply one\'s <em>atmasakti</em>,\r\n or the power of self-making, and reimagine the land through \"one\'s own \r\nknowledge, intelligence, love and effort.\" Therefore, to Tagore, \r\npatriotism possessed added meaning and significance to its political and\r\n popular usage; it had an imaginative and a spiritual side that eluded \r\nmost people, who professed their love and loyalty to a country merely \r\nbecause they were its inhabitants.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, Tagore believed in the harmony and co-existence of the \r\nopposing spirits of attachment and detachment. \"In their union dwells \r\nthe ideal of perfection,\" he wrote in \"The Fourfold Way of India.\" In \r\nthe context of patriotism, this means that while one should love one\'s \r\ncountry, one should still remain spiritually detached from it. \"The \r\nharmony of bondage and freedom is the dance of creation,\" Tagore \r\nexplained. He developed this idea beautifully using the metaphor of \r\nwalking: \"In the act of walking, attachment is in the step that the foot\r\n takes when it touches the earth; detachment is in the movement of the \r\nother foot when it raises itself.\" Given this metaphysical aspect to \r\nTagore\'s understanding of the concept, it is no surprise that he \r\nactively distanced himself from and disparaged the same idea when it was\r\n discussed among politicians and the masses in mundane everyday speech.</p>\r\n<p>A similar kind of ambivalence appears in Tagore\'s treatment of the \r\nconcept of cosmopolitanism. We know that throughout his writings Tagore \r\nspoke about creating a world culture and bringing humanity together in \r\n\"one nest.\" He longed for a world that was \"free from all antagonisms of\r\n race, nationality, creed or caste\" and that \"[had] not been broken up \r\ninto fragments by narrow domestic walls.\" In his Nobel Prize acceptance \r\nspeech in 1913, Tagore categorically stated, \"India is there to unite \r\nall human races.\" In a letter to his son Rathindranath, dated 11 October\r\n 1916, he further stated, \"The age of narrow chauvinism is coming to an \r\nend – for the sake of the future, the first steps towards this great \r\nmeeting of world humanity will be taken on this very fields of Bolpur\" \r\n(where Tagore\'s institutions Santiniketan and Visva Bharati are \r\nlocated).</p>\r\n<p>In spite of such supra-national aspirations and desire to create a <em>mahajati</em>\r\n (grand human community) through the harmony of all human races, Tagore –\r\n somewhat curiously – spurned the idea of cosmopolitanism on at least \r\none occasion. Pairing it with nationalism in his book <em>Nationalism</em>,\r\n he disdainfully stated, \"Neither the colourless vagueness of \r\ncosmopolitanism, nor the fierce self-idolatry of nation-worship is the \r\ngoal of human history.\" This statement seemingly undercuts everything \r\nthat Tagore envisioned with regard to creating a global fellowship of \r\nhumanity and cultivating cultural cooperation and an international mind.</p>\r\n<p>So why did Tagore make such a dismissive comment on cosmopolitanism? \r\nPerhaps it was his attempt to reject the type of specifically <em>political</em>\r\n cosmopolitanism that was developing in Asia around the same time, in \r\nwhich the British Empire was expected to evolve into a new cosmopolitan \r\nsuper-state, and nationalism to be realised in a federation of nations. \r\nThe leaders of this project included such cosmopolitan visionaries as \r\nDr. Lim Boon Keng in Singapore, Anand de Souza in Sri Lanka and the \r\nTheosophists in India, headed by Anne Besant. These individuals, as Mark\r\n R. Frost explains, did not give up their \"nationalist aspirations\" but \r\nrather, wanted to tie it \"to demands for a \'reconstructed\' British \r\nEmpire, an imperial federation and even a League of Nations that would… \r\neventually (following the end of global hostilities [after World War I])\r\n usher in a new age of peace and brotherhood.\"</p>\r\n<p>For example, Dr. Lim Boon Keng, a Chinese nationalist and Empire \r\nloyalist, envisioned the great potential of the British Empire to bring \r\nabout a \"great union\" and a \"cosmic harmony\" in which the Empire itself \r\nwould act as the vehicle. To attain such \"unity\" and \"oneness\" of \r\nhumanity, Lim \"advocated the further extension of English as the <em>lingua franca</em>\r\n of the British Empire.\" In Sri Lanka, likewise, de Souza dreamed of a \r\n\"World-Britain\" in which the British Empire would turn into a \r\n\"commonwealth of nations,\" wherein \"No more shall we be two empires – \r\n\'White\' and \'coloured\' under a single name – but one, where all shall \r\nhave rights as they are able to bear responsibility.\" Similarly, in \r\nIndia, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, one of the adherents of Besant\'s political \r\nideas, when asked why he was not in favour of India separating from the \r\nEmpire like the Sinn Feiners in Ireland, replied, \"We want to be in the \r\nEmpire on terms of equality. We do not want to separate ourselves, but \r\nwe want to extend within the League of the Empire.\"</p>\r\n<p>Tagore was not interested in any such political cosmopolitanism that \r\nwould transform the Empire into a gigantic nation, in which the \r\nindividual would still have to sacrifice his/her moral qualities for \r\nsome political and commercial gain and surrender his/her spontaneous \r\nself to a virulent self-seeking and artificial life, which would bring \r\npower and prosperity but no inner fulfilment or lasting peace.</p>\r\n<p>Tagore\'s cosmopolitanism was more cultural and spiritual in nature, \r\nin which the individual would be expected to share a sense of \r\nhospitality and sympathy towards all fellow human beings, and maintain a\r\n sense of openness to the world around him. Kwame Anthony Appiah is of \r\nthe view that a principle characteristic of cosmopolitanism is a feeling\r\n of obligation to others, beyond family and kinship ties, \"or even the \r\nmore formal ties of a shared citizenship,\" an interest in the values and\r\n practices that lend significance to other people. Tagore\'s \r\ncosmopolitanism shares these spiritual-cultural qualities advocated by \r\nAppiah and others, as opposed to the League of Empire type of \r\ncosmopolitanism championed by those contemporaries named above. Thus, \r\nrejecting political unity vis-à-vis spiritual unity, in his Nobel Prize \r\nacceptance speech Tagore affirmed, \"Therefore, no superficial bond of \r\npolitical unity can appeal to us, can satisfy us, can ever be real to \r\nus…. We must discover the most profound unity, the spiritual unity \r\nbetween the different races.\"</p>', '', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 1, 4, '2020-06-19 03:52:32'),

With the forbearance of a deathless dead I have been gently \r\nkissing on ashes and dust, waiting for an end of days. For what seems \r\nlike an eternity I have been here, resting in a vicious cycle of morbid \r\nrestlessness. Not a minute of respite I could afford to grow one strand \r\nof grass on the stony wasteland I call my home; not a minute to spare so\r\n I can grow a wee wildflower of bluish hue at one corner of my crown, \r\nnor can I speak though I see it all feelingly. Footsteps— footsteps all \r\nover my ancient bones — millions of them repeating in a cacophonic \r\nnightmare. But it is also true that I can read their heart as I trace \r\ntheir feet. I know who is going home, who is leaving, who is out for \r\nwork, who is back from work, who is about to start for a festival or \r\nbeing carried to the cemetery. The ones who are happy — truly happy with\r\n their lives— are bound by affection and esteem, have a certain air to \r\ntheir light trots and with each step, they plant a seed of hope as if \r\nevery course they choose on their way feels favored and sprouts floras \r\nof all sorts. And those unfortunate ones with no home or no hopes to \r\nlive by are desperately lost for I feel the utter weariness their heavy \r\ntreads seem to tell, wondering just what might be the point of living a \r\nlife after all. Their hardened pace further flattens the already dried \r\nskeleton I loath to call my own.</p>\r\n<p>For all that, I can never claim to hear all sides of a story. For \r\nhundreds of years have I been keenly listening to laughter and songs of \r\nso many, but it is never quite the all of it, you see! I long for the \r\nrest of what I missed but by then the storyteller is gone. I have lost \r\ncount of the fragments of unheard stories that died along with my dry \r\ndust every now and then. Hold on, did you hear that? Someone just sighed\r\n in silence, \"If only I could say what needed to be said!\" Wait, please!\r\n I will listen, I promise! Even if they don\'t! But the walker doesn\'t \r\nlook back, leaving behind the story and also me half-fed, vainly \r\nsearching for clues. That one nameless man and his unheard tale keep me \r\nawake till the dawn sneaks in with another newcomer and their share of \r\nsecrets.</p>\r\n<p>Everything comes to an end on its own accord, but I do not see mine. \r\nNot one footprint can I hold onto for long as it is soon replaced by the\r\n next and leaves no trace whatsoever behind.</p>\r\n<p>I am not a destination, however, and have never been. I am just the \r\nmedium you choose as a part of your journey. I do not offer the comfort \r\nof a home one seeks, just the route you have to cross to reach your \r\naddress. I am the one miserable surface of concrete you carelessly \r\ntread, never to stay; suffering an existence ever-cursed and condemned \r\nby you for an effort ironically I have to make at your convenience. The \r\nhardly audible bits and pieces of your household jokes, laughter and \r\nmerry songs disappear into nothingness till they reach my cold distant \r\ncemented ears, as if I am the last one to appreciate the life that you \r\nlive, let alone deserve it!</p>\r\n<p>But then again, perhaps it is not a complete loss after all. It\'s the\r\n little children who seem to enjoy my company the most, the bringers of \r\njoy and hopefulness. They play with my dust, utter little sweet things \r\nand their light feet fluttering like butterflies all over my rigid frame\r\n suddenly seem to fill me up with a yearning for a life I never had. \r\nUltimately, they leave, too for all do.</p>\r\n<p>And I do have to admit here again that I am familiar with each and \r\nevery pedestrian that walks me by and I know them for who they are. I \r\nwait for them and imagine what they might be doing at home the day they \r\nare not over here. I clearly remember those beautiful pair of sad \r\nanklets shying away from the crowd with her lips pouted and big bright \r\neyes complaining to the evening sky as she would pace fast along my \r\npavement. I recall her standing often beneath that big banyan which \r\nstands still at my left end. Well, there was another who used to hum to \r\nhimself before making his way straight towards the crowd. He never \r\nlooked at anyone, never took a break and stopped whistling only when his\r\n feet would touch the backyard. Once he had left, the girl would have \r\ndone the same, ever so softly as if not to awake anyone. When she would \r\nbe closer to my side, I knew it was the nighttime slowly covering the \r\nearth leaving trails of its cold wet touch upon us. Soon it would be way\r\n past the twilight and the entire place was deserted.</p>\r\n<p>The evening breeze would then softly stir the evergreen blooming \r\nbamboos, gentle yet lasting. And I could feel her slight nervous steps \r\nevery day and every month till there was a time when she disappeared \r\ninto thin air. A beautiful Falgun afternoon it was towards the end of \r\nthe month with hundreds and thousands of young and raw mango buds about \r\nto bloom and burst in the open air. She was there but not he. The girl \r\nwent back home very late at that night. Just as some dry dead leaves \r\nwould occasionally fall from the tree and let me know the change of \r\nseasons, I could sense her teardrops caressing my concrete chest as she \r\nleft. The next day she was here again but not her companion. That night,\r\n she could not walk very far and fell into my lap of dirt surrendering \r\nto the inevitable. Who might you be, dear girl, and where are you from \r\nseeking refuge in me, the last place on earth to be at such an ungodly \r\nhour? What is it the universe is planning, placing you here with me? I \r\nwondered.</p>\r\n<p>That was the night I met her for the last time.</p>\r\n<p>Hundreds of stories like these have lived and died with me, and I \r\nhave tried to keep track as diligently as it is possible. But of course,\r\n there are too many. They come and then they leave, never to stay.</p>\r\n<p>And oh, the heat of the summer, if only you had known what I am \r\ntalking about! Every time I breathe, I tend to forget that the sky is \r\nblue, blackened and soiled with my foulsome dirt. Be it the rich, the \r\npoor, the happy, the morose, the young, or the ancient, all but just \r\ndrift,  drift and drift away in the sandstorm made of their own feet \r\ntill there is no sign of their existence left on my broad unkind \r\nstomach. Neither I smile, nor I mourn. No nostalgia for the past, no \r\nhopes for the present and no plans for the future, I have only got the \r\nnewest cascade of human feet to entertain. Now who dares to claim a \r\nfootfall the echo of which will survive the end of times, you ask? The \r\nsighs and whispers you so cautiously hide as you make your way on me, \r\nwill they survive in the airy emptiness you are leaving behind, or will \r\nthey mark the shadow of the new soon to replace the ghosts of your once \r\ntold stories? Can the airy nothings survive the weight of the air \r\nitself? If you ask me, I will be the wrong one to answer, for all I know\r\n is that I am here and now, because I have to be.</p>', '0', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 4, '2020-06-17 03:53:48'),

Rabindranath goes on\r\n in his speech to envision \"a dawn\" emerging eventually, in all \r\nlikelihood from the East, \"where the sun rises,\" to allow humankind to \r\nreclaim their \"lost heritage\" (216).</p>\r\n<p>Rabindranath Tagore thus offered to a world, even when fratricidal \r\narmies were clashing bloodily in one of the gloomiest phases of human \r\nhistory, a \"ray of hope\" through his vision of the future. This is why I\r\n believe that the theme chosen by the Indian High Commission of \r\nBangladesh at this critical juncture of human existence is a \r\nparticularly apt one—<em>kabiguru</em> offers us through this final \r\naddress to the world, as he always did through his works and \r\nphilosophical musings as well as his actions, a demonstration of his \r\nunwavering faith in humankind. Rabindranath, is ultimately the poet of \r\nhope, encouraging all of us to cope with public as well as personal \r\ncrises, through his actions, as well as his words. Now that we are in a \r\ncorona-infected world, confined to our homes, constricted in our \r\nmovements, and leading cramped lives in shrinking, bordered spaces, more\r\n than ever, we need to remember on this birthday event what Rabindranath\r\n articulated at every turn of his eighty years in the planet---hope is \r\nwhat we can never abandon. For him, the sun will rise again and break \r\nthrough night, inevitably, naturally and invigoratingly. Surely, his \r\nfather Maharshi Debendranath Tagore had been prophetic in naming him \r\nRabindranath— for he is truly \"Robi,\" a sun who can guide us in these, \r\nand all other times of crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Personally, I am more addicted to Rabindranath\'s songs than any other\r\n genres or creative outlets that streamed from him, and so let me focus \r\nin particular on one of his best-loved songs, \"Anandodhara Bohiche \r\nBhubane,\" (Happiness Streams Across the Universe), to see how he himself\r\n coped with personally difficult situations. The song was composed in \r\n1908 at a time when Rabindranath had become overwhelmed by personal \r\ntragedies. His dear wife and unfailing helpmeet Mrinalini Devi became \r\nill and died on 23 November, 1902; nine months later, his daughter \r\nRenuka died at the age of thirteen; Satis Roy, a young poet and teacher \r\nof his Shantiniketan school he was particularly fond of, died four \r\nmonths later of typhoid then raging in Bengal, and his youngest and \r\ndearest child, the thirteen-year old Samindra, died of cholera in \r\nNovember 1907. As Rabindranath\'s biographer Krishna Kripalani, puts it, \r\nit was as if God had \"sent him, as He had done to His Servant Job of the\r\n Old Testament, a series of bereavements and afflictions\" to try him \r\n(201). What he does in the song, however, is admonish himself for \r\nletting depression grip him when God seemed to be sending down every day\r\n reasons for living. As Rabindranath berates himself in the song, why \r\nwas he sitting alone, submerged in the self, and \"feeling forlorn,\" when\r\n day and night heavenly bliss was splashing across the universe, and the\r\n sun and moon beaming down forever? He should rather consider his \r\nsorrows \"inconsequential,\" fill the void in his life with love for \r\nothers, and act positively. This then is the kind of philosophical \r\nmusing offering rays of hope to us that we can recall on his 159th \r\nbirthday in this corona-infected year.</p>\r\n<p>Let us remember at this time too that during these years of \r\nbereavement, Rabindranath was fully involved in all kinds of \r\nhumanitarian and national causes and not only writing poetry and staying\r\n depressed. After all, these were the years when he was running his \r\nfledgling school in Shantiniketan set up for altruistic purposes with \r\nhis own money, taking an active part in the swadeshi movement till he \r\ngot fed up with its excesses and increasingly communal bent, and working\r\n on schemes to help the peasants in his estates in east Bengal lead \r\nbetter lives.</p>\r\n<p>Always, Rabindranath was the activist coming up with ways of helping \r\npeople cope with the consequences of the natural or man-made disasters \r\nperiodically ravaging the subcontinent. An example that comes to my mind\r\n on this occasion is the way he decided to aid the victims of people \r\nsuffering from the famine-like conditions created by floods in North \r\nBengal in 1932. What he did on this occasion was adapt for performance \r\nthe long poem he had first written in English titled \"The Child\" that he\r\n had subsequently recreated as the Bengali poem \"Shisu Thirta\" in 1932. \r\nThis adapted version became a Kolkata fund-raising event organized to \r\nhelp distressed people. What we find then is Rabindranath typically \r\ncontributing the way he could at a moment of crisis, yet again.</p>\r\n<p>The Rabindranath I would like us to commemorate on this birthday \r\nwebinar is therefore the activist, as well as the seer-poet, who offered\r\n again and again rays of hope for his people through his life and works.\r\n In a part of the book he translated as <em>Thoughts from Rabindranath Tagore,</em>\r\n he urges us to \"meet the morning light\" and not sit with our face \r\n\"turned away\" from it; in his essay on \"Hindus and Muslims,\" he exhorts \r\nthem to \'demolish the barriers that have been built\" in their minds; in \r\nanother essay titled \"The Tenant Farmer\" he points out that no matter \r\nhow difficult the situation is, one must not give up \"the will to live\";\r\n in his breakthrough poem \"Nirjharer Swapna-Bhanga\" or \"The Fountain\'s \r\nAwakening\" he is rhapsodic in the final line because \"the sun has \r\nfinally found its way!\" In another poem \"Sabhyatar Prati\" or \"To \r\nCivilization\" he declares that we must \"burst through all barriers that \r\nhem us in and feel/This boundless universe\'s pulsating heartbeat!\" In \r\nhis last, death-bed poem, \"Tomar Srishtir Poth\" or \"On the Way to \r\nCreation\", he tells us to embrace \"truth\" and cleanse \"our innermost \r\nbeing by its light\". And in a song-lyric he wrote on one of his \r\nbirthdays, \"Hey Notun\" or \"O Herald of the New,\" he urges himself to be \r\n\"Like the rising sun/ Burst through the heart of the void and unveil \r\nyourself/ Let life be revealed as triumphant.\"</p>\r\n<p>Rabindranath Tagore, then, is forever our \"robi\" shining steadfastly \r\nover our part of the world, sending his rays of hope across the \r\nsubcontinent, and even to other parts of the world, warming our hearts \r\nand minds with his poems, songs, plays, dance-dramas, fiction, prose, \r\nthe institutions he created like Visva-Bharati or Sriniketan, and, \r\nindeed, through his exemplary life. His musings on the world of the \r\nspirit, harmony between peoples, the limitations of nationalism and the \r\nneed for an international outlook; his thoughts on rural reconstruction,\r\n cooperative development, preserving the environment and education \r\namidst nature are as relevant as ever.  For us in Bangladesh, in \r\nparticular, he has been an unending source of inspiration and a \r\nsustaining force.  For our two nations, of course, he is a bond that is \r\npermanent. On this birthday webinar, being organized at a time when our \r\npeople are trying to cope with the crisis brought about by Covid-19, we \r\nknow that he is a ray of hope we can turn to and be inspired by as we \r\nmove on to better days and a brighter future.</p>', '0', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 1, '2020-08-18 03:54:36');

The angst, \r\nthe wounds linger on through even pandemics like COVID 19.</p>\r\n<p>Was this divide a need of the Muslims or was it a result of politics \r\nbeyond the comprehension of a common citizen of the Indian subcontinent,\r\n irrespective of the religion?</p>\r\n<p>Sameer Arshad Khatlani, a journalist who had been with <em>The Times of India</em> during his trip, and then in <em>Indian Express</em> and now in <em>Hindustan Times</em>,\r\n journeyed to Lahore for a Peace Conference in December 2013 and in the \r\nprocess uncovered a story beyond the one given out. Though his book is \r\ncompacted within that time period, it took years of research to write \r\nthe book and it was finally published in 2020, just post the riots in \r\nDelhi and a little before COVID 19 disrupted our way of life. The book \r\nwas something he wanted to do. In an earlier interview, he tells us, \"I \r\nhave always been very curious about Pakistan and wanted to write the \r\nbook because I thought I have a unique, layered perspective that will \r\nmake it compelling given the straight jacketed approach towards that \r\ncountry in India. The focus in India on issues that reinforce the same \r\nold view of Pakistan has left many compelling stories untold. I wanted \r\nto narrate those. Pakistan is a complex country and I thought its \r\ncomplexities were worth exploring in the form of a book.\"</p>\r\n<p>His book starts with the dilemma of Muslims who continued in India. \r\nThey were not in favour of such a divide as it would upend their lives. \r\nAnd it did. They ended up in refugee camp. The reason given for the \r\ndivide was politics per se: \"Pakistan\'s idea as a separate Muslim \r\nhomeland—which was dismissed as \'chimerical and impractical\' in the \r\n1930s—now suddenly gathered steam. a tacit British support was at \r\nplay—the payback Muhammad ali Jinnah received for backing the British \r\nwar effort.\"</p>\r\n<p>Khatlani gives a first-person account. His family itself opposed his \r\ntrip. He clarifies, their reactions or that of many Indian Muslims \"can \r\nbe traced to a latent legacy of wounds the subcontinent\'s division \r\ninflicted on them and millions of other ordinary people.\" They felt \r\nvisiting Pakistan would be \"rash.\" Khatlani elaborates, \"Like any \r\naverage Indian, they hear, see and watch nothing that might humanize \r\nPakistan. Not surprisingly, the country comes across as a hopelessly \r\ndark land because to its portrayal in the news media, the cinema, as \r\nwell as the terror attacks that emanate from that country.\" When he does\r\n journey across, he finds a world where \"India\'s \'soft power\', the reach\r\n and impact of Bollywood, helps offset anti-India sentiments in \r\nPakistan. it humanizes India among the Pakistani masses; many shared \r\nproblems besetting the two countries thus appear to be lopsided.\"</p>\r\n<p>He takes us through Pakistan weaving in how Partition created \r\nruptures where none had been. The Radcliffe line split communities and \r\nvillages. His telling is reminiscent of the fallacy described in Larry \r\nCollins\' Dominique La Pierre\'s book <em>Freedom at Midnight </em>(1975).\r\n \"Sometimes the line ran down the heart of a village, leaving a dozen \r\nhuts in India, a dozen more in Pakistan. Occasionally it even bisected a\r\n home, leaving a front door opening onto India and a rear window looking\r\n into Pakistan.\"</p>\r\n<p>Khatlani factors in the human suffering sustained over the years by \r\nthe community, the aftermath. He explains how \"almost all Bhanu Chak \r\nresidents have roots in Alwar and Bharatpur. However, none of them had \r\nbeen able to travel to meet their relatives in decades.\"</p>\r\n<p>An interesting, fast paced, well written, nuanced to perfection, \r\nbalanced, journalistic read, much like his articles, the book is an \r\nunputdownable one — a bit like a thriller. His exploration reminds me of\r\n Dan Brown\'s Prof Langdon, though Khatlani unravels lesser known facets \r\nof history and politics, unlike the thriller hero who cracks mysteries \r\nby cracking codes. Khatlani journeys through the famed Liberty and \r\nAnarkali <em>bazaars</em> of Lahore and by lanes and shuttles between taxi-drivers, liberals and artistes.</p>\r\n<p>He talks to the driver who was taking him around, Aziz, one of the \r\nmany people whose family was forced to cross over and had \"neither \r\nresources nor connections to revisit their roots. so, they relish the \r\nrare idea of talking to somebody from \'that side\'. Aziz told me that his\r\n grandfather would get emotional every time he saw a visitor from \r\nIndia…No bitter memories of the Partition seemed to have passed on to \r\nAziz from the survivors of the Partition slaughter in his family. \r\nVagaries of life have weighed down the family\'s three generations, \r\nleaving them with little time to harbour any ill will.\"</p>\r\n<p>There are these anecdotes from the times of Mughals and earlier, gems\r\n of shared history with Pakistan that he embeds into his narrative, \r\ncomments and observations of the mutiplicity of languages and cultures \r\non the other side of the divide, the open attitude of their liberals and\r\n the affection he experienced from common folks. He talks of the terror \r\nthat runs through Pakistan, terror created by a revival of Kharijites \r\n\"who have emerged in different forms and targeted Muslims since first \r\nrebelling against and killing Prophet Muhammad\'s companion and third \r\ncaliph, Usman, in the seventh century.\" He concludes the book telling us\r\n \"radical Kharijites were eventually defeated but some survived. Many \r\nsee a revival of radical Kharijite legacy in the late twentieth-century \r\nterrorist activities of groups like the Taliban and al- Qaeda.\"</p>\r\n<p>Khatlani brings in plenty of syncretic lore like during Partition, \r\n\"the rubabis lost their livelihood; they had spent years learning the \r\nSikh holy book by heart for it.\" Rubabis are Muslim singers who evolved \r\nfrom Guru Nanak\'s times and performed in Sikh shrines, like that in \r\nAmritsar. He describes temples across Pakistan, especially the Hingjal \r\nShrine in the remote mountains of Baluchistan which hosted pilgrims from\r\n across the divide in 2006. He meets Sikhs and Hindus, who have been \r\ndeveloping Pakistan just as Muslims like A.P.J. Abul Kalam or Fakhruddin\r\n Ali Ahmed had been committed to developing India.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, a little before Khatlani\'s book was launched, a \r\nfiction on the same syncretic theme, Sahitya Akademi award winner Aruna \r\nChakravarti\'s <em>Suralakshmi Villa</em> (Feb 2020) and Avik Chanda\'s best-selling historical <em>Dara Shukoh, the Man who would be King </em>(Nov\r\n 2019) invaded book shelves, taking India by storm with their focused \r\nsyncretic telling of the Ganga- Yamuna tehzeeb. One of the things to \r\nponder is why would writers of different genres within a span of four \r\nmonths from varied backgrounds be so focused on the same syncretic \r\nthread in Indian lore?

The women\'s movement has always\r\n been deeply rooted in this society. As we move from one era to another,\r\n we can trace overarching themes of eliminating violence against women, \r\nfighting for reproductive rights, striving for political and economic \r\nempowerment, resisting religious subordination and ensuring public \r\nroles. The movement has been involved in fighting for legal rights, \r\nchallenging existing discourse, increasing representation, pushing for \r\npolicy changes and, most importantly, challenging mind-sets in a \r\nrepressive patriarchal society. This is a glimpse into the journey \r\nacross a century – one of great adversaries and greater women.</p><h2><strong>British Period </strong></h2>\r\n<p>This period saw public discourse around women\'s rights and roles in \r\nthe Bengali-Muslim society largely shaped by male perspective, including\r\n some urban educated middle-class and upper-class women. A small class \r\nof exceptions – women such as Begum Rokeya – went against the norm and \r\nbecame thought leaders in the women\'s movement. Today, Rokeya Sakhawat \r\nHossain (1880-1932) is recognised as a pioneering activist for women\'s \r\neducation and economic independence. However, what is often side-lined \r\nis her constructive and critical literary work that challenged entire \r\nsystems upholding patriarchy, including religion. \"Sultana\'s Dream,\" one\r\n of the earliest depictions of feminist utopia, uses the concept of \r\ngender role reversal to highlight the perceived notion of male \r\nsuperiority. \"Secluded Women\" is a critique of the extreme forms of <em>purdah</em>\r\n imposed on women, acting as obstacles towards their emancipation. For \r\nthe first time in the region\'s history, feminist discourse was shaped \r\nand informed by women themselves.</p>\r\n<p>During the same time period, revolutionaries like Pritilata Waddedar \r\n(1911-1932) and Kalpana Datta (1913-1995) took up arms in the \r\nnationalist struggle against British occupation. Pritilata did not only \r\nlead the successful raid of the European Club in Chattogram at just 21, \r\nbut her participation in the anti-colonial struggle, along with that of \r\nseveral other fearless female revolutionaries, opened up political and \r\npublic spheres to women.</p><h2><strong>Pakistan Period (1947-1970)</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In 1970, Sufia Kamal founded Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, the \r\ncountry\'s oldest women\'s rights organisation to date. Ever since, the \r\norganisation has been a dominant force in shaping the roles of \r\nBangladeshi women in politics and society.</p>\r\n<p>Bangladesh Mahila Parishad is the prime example of how efforts in \r\nmobilising women led to changes in legal and political systems. Building\r\n off the momentum of the social uprising against dowry in the late 70s, \r\nthey raised the Anti-Dowry Bill – with 30,000 signatures – in Parliament\r\n and finally got it passed in 1980. While the practice of dowry still \r\npersists in many places and much has to be done in the way of \r\nimplementation, this was a historic win for the women\'s movement as they\r\n were successful in garnering support from across the political spectrum\r\n to outlaw an outdated practice.</p>\r\n<p>Another one of Bangladesh Mahila Parishad\'s major undertakings was \r\nthe demand for a Uniform Family Code across all religious communities \r\ninstead of personal law which depends on women\'s religious backgrounds. \r\nAfter numerous consultations at the national and local levels in the \r\nlate 80s and 90s, a draft was developed. However, due to the reluctance \r\nof some religious minority groups and the state\'s apprehension due to \r\nperceived backlash from groups with religious affiliations, the Code was\r\n never passed.</p>\r\n<p>For Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, advocacy for women\'s increased \r\npolitical participation has always been a primary agenda. By using media\r\n such as seminars and conventions alongside street activism and \r\nprotests, they have continued to demand more reserved seats for women in\r\n Parliament, as well as direct election for those seats. As they stand \r\nfirm in their belief that female involvement in decision-making and \r\nlegislation is essential for women\'s empowerment, this remains a major \r\narea of their work, even today. Direct election at local levels, \r\nhowever, has significantly improved women\'s political rights and \r\nparticipation.</p><h2><strong>Post-Liberation (1971-1990)</strong></h2>\r\n<p>Women also took up space in the policy circle, pushing for changes \r\nthat addressed women\'s needs. The First Five-Year Plan of Bangladesh \r\nonly identified the need for women\'s development in terms of motherhood \r\nand rehabilitation of war victims. To overcome the gap, Rounaq Jahan \r\nfounded Women for Women in 1973. Known as one of the first feminist \r\norganisations focusing on research and advocacy, it published the first \r\ncomprehensive report on challenges faced by women. The data and \r\nstatistics required to integrate the needs of women into policy were \r\ngenerated; knowledge creation became a prominent tool of the women\'s \r\nmovement.</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the 70s, there was a growing consciousness of the varied \r\nexperiences of women across Bangladesh. With the establishment of \r\norganisations such as <em>Banchte Shekha</em> (Learn How to Survive), the scope of the women\'s movement was expanded beyond the urban upper and middle-class.</p>\r\n<p>The activism of Dr Angela Gomes, Founder and Executive Director of <em>Banchte Shekha,</em>\r\n grew out of her personal experiences and observations. She was raised \r\nin a small village near Dhaka. As she rode around the countryside of \r\nJashore on a bicycle, she began interacting with fellow women, talking \r\nabout the different forms of violence that they had faced. Many women \r\nwere either abandoned or abused by their husbands. Through these \r\nconversations, she began to offer what little help she could. Seeing her\r\n as a threat to the traditional way of life, men in stark opposition \r\nthrew rocks and human excrement at her. To legitimise her presence, she \r\nestablished <em>Banchte Shekha</em> as an NGO in 1976. Her work is \r\nrooted in the goal of helping women achieve financial independence, \r\nmimicking the ideals Begum Rokeya brought forth over half a century \r\nago.  As such, the organisation teaches rural women income-generating \r\nskills like fish farming, raising crops and livestock, and handicrafts. \r\nWith their earnings, women have formed extensive networks of \r\nmoney-lending schemes to help others during times of crisis. Primary \r\nschooling programmes for adults, as well as courses on maternal and \r\nbasic health, are also provided. Even further, the organisation trains \r\nparalegals in Muslim family law. As a result, the typical all-male \r\nmediation panels for issues such as domestic violence, dowry disputes \r\nand child support now include members of <em>Banchte Shekha</em> as arbitrators.</p>\r\n<p>The organisation\'s reach today is 25,000 women in 430 villages. With \r\nDr Gomes\' acute understanding of the demographic, each programme rises \r\nout of a specific need felt by the women she works with. \"The aim of <em>Banchte Shekha</em>,\" Dr Gomes said in an old interview, \"is not to rescue women, but to help them learn to live.\"</p>\r\n<p>While Bangladeshi women\'s issues became more and more prominent in \r\nthe national landscape, there was a severe lack of representation of \r\nindigenous women\'s rights. In 1988, the Hill Women\'s Federation (HWF) \r\nwas formed to help bring focus on raising consciousness among the Jumma \r\nwomen about their rights and duties as the most repressed section of the\r\n Jumma society in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Kalpana Chakma, the \r\n20-year-old organising secretary of the Federation, rose to prominence \r\nbecause of her tireless activism and began to garner both national and \r\ninternational attention. She helped bring attention to an issue that \r\nstill prevails in our country today: the repression of indigenous people\r\n by Bengali settlers. She put emphasis on working for the rights of \r\nindigenous women by organising conferences, seminars and meetings in \r\nseveral areas of the Hill Tracts. The HWF is, as Kalpana Chakma was, \r\nexceptionally vocal on the topic of Jumma women resisting repression at \r\nthe hands of the Bangladesh Army, and organises protest demonstrations \r\non all incidents of human rights violations against them. In a country \r\nwhere dialogue centred on the rights of indigenous people is left out of\r\n the national discourse, Kalpana Chakma helped create momentum on this \r\njourney by trying to build a more inclusive community.</p><h2><strong>My Body, My Right </strong><strong>– 1990s</strong></h2>\r\n<p>In the 1990s, a new form of organising amongst women\'s rights \r\norganisations – at the intersection of activism, research and advocacy –\r\n seemed to emerge. There was a focus on the physical and sexual violence\r\n experienced by women in public and private spheres.</p>\r\n<p>One of the more radical groups during this time was Naripokkho, a \r\ncollective of women\'s rights activists with a mission to centre their \r\nwork on their personal experiences as women. Naripokkho played a \r\nsignificant role in establishing the issue of violence against women as a\r\n determinant for their position in society and starting national \r\ndialogue around women\'s bodily rights, including sexual rights. One of \r\ntheir more controversial campaigns was under the theme <em>Shorir Amar, Shiddhanto Amar </em>(My\r\n Body, My Decision). While the aim was to strive for women\'s right to \r\ntake decisions about their own bodies, the slogan was deemed as overly \r\nsexual or vulgar, with sexual freedom being equated with promiscuity. \r\nToday, Naripokkho has expanded their focus to issues surrounding gender \r\nand healthcare, environment, and political empowerment.</p>\r\n<p>Naripokkho has also been a strong ally in the fight for sex workers\' \r\nrights in Bangladesh. Following the evictions of sex workers from \r\nbrothels in the late 1990s, sex workers mobilised and became more \r\npolitically active in the context of the women\'s movement. Mumtaz Begum,\r\n an evicted sex worker from one of the brothels, contacted Naripokkho \r\nand staged a protest in front of the Press Club. This led to the \r\nformation of Ulka, an organisation that aimed to destigmatise the life \r\nand work of sex workers. Sex work in Bangladesh is often seen as a \r\nfunction of poverty, thus evoking the standard welfare response of \r\nrehabilitation into marriages and \"respectable\" occupations. Ulka\'s \r\ncampaign questioned these \"rehabilitation\" prescriptions and instead \r\nraised an agenda of \"social acceptance\" involving recognising sex work \r\nas a legitimate occupation. After the Tanbazar eviction in 1991, Ulka \r\nand Naripokkho joined forces in order to strategise ways to bring the \r\nsituation under control. Around 84 women\'s and human rights\' \r\norganisations and development NGOs representing a wide spectrum of views\r\n on social change came together to form Shonghoti, an alliance in \r\nsupport of the rights of sex workers. By bringing the hardships of sex \r\nworkers into the limelight, the links between the many different \r\nrealities of women in and out of sex work became evident. These efforts \r\nchanged how sex work was viewed in the community. A shift in terminology\r\n was observed when print media started referring to sex workers as <em>jouno kormi</em>, instead of <em>potita</em>\r\n (prostitute; literal meaning: \"the fallen one\"). This was a step \r\ntowards removing the shame associated with sex work, and the social \r\ndiscrimination that was attached with it. Sex work was finally addressed\r\n as an occupation and sex workers had claims to workers\' rights. The \r\nimportance of sharing the stories of sex workers in order to remove the \r\nstigma surrounding this field of work was recognised. A new solidarity \r\nbetween sections of the \"mainstream\" women\'s movement and sex workers\' \r\nstruggles was forged.</p>\r\n<p>A prevalent form of violence against women at the time was acid \r\nthrowing. Nasreen Huq, a member of Naripokkho, founded and led a \r\nnational campaign against acid violence and this, in turn, led to the \r\nformation of the Acid Survivors Foundation. Through her work, Nasreen \r\nHuq moved beyond providing survivors with medical and legal support and \r\nhelped reintegrate acid survivors into society through education, \r\nemployment and social interaction. In fact, her relentless advocacy \r\nactually led to a sharp fall in the number of acid attacks against women\r\n in Bangladesh.</p><h2><strong>Towards greater inclusion:  2003 and beyond</strong></h2>\r\n<p><strong><em>Economic Justice</em></strong>\r\n</p><p>This was a period of economic transition for the \r\nagriculture-dependent society of Bangladesh. More economic opportunities\r\n also created scope for labour exploitation, especially of women. Nazma \r\nAkter, Founder and Executive Director of Awaj Foundation, has been \r\nfighting to improve workers\' rights in the garments sector in Bangladesh\r\n for over 32 years. Working at garments factories since the age of 11, \r\nshe witnessed the abusive nature of typically male employers towards \r\nfemale workers. The trade unions, meant to offer solutions, were plagued\r\n with their own issues of gender-based discrimination, so she ultimately\r\n decided to form her own. Founded in 2003, Awaj Foundation is driven by \r\nthe vision of decent work, dignified lives and gender equity in the \r\nindustrial sectors of Bangladesh. It raises awareness on garments \r\nworkers\' struggles, educates them on their rights under national and \r\ninternational legal frameworks and builds their capacity for leadership \r\nand negotiation of better working conditions. 52 anti-harassment \r\ncommittees have been set up in factories in Dhaka and Chattogram \r\ndivisions with their assistance. As a women-led organisation, addressing\r\n gender-based violence is one of Awaj\'s main priorities. Nazma Akter \r\nputs particular emphasis on increasing women\'s participation in \r\ndecision-making at the workplace and at home. Thereby, Awaj Foundation \r\nushered the ideals of the women\'s movement into a crucial sector.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Trans Rights </em></strong></p>\r\n<p>From an early age, Joya Sikder\'s experience as a transgender woman \r\nhas made her vulnerable to violence and degradation. The abuse she faced\r\n was not only limited to strangers but persisted even within her own \r\nhome and community. She began her activism at an NGO and continued it as\r\n a research associate seeking to depict the issues faced by the \r\nBangladeshi transgender populace, eventually founding her own \r\norganisation, Somporker Noya Setu (SNS). Through her work, she strives \r\nto help members of the transgender community live as free citizens – \r\nproviding them with work opportunities, promoting safe working \r\nconditions, actively protesting against their exclusion from a sexual \r\nrights bill on the basis of sexual \"disability\" and publishing articles \r\non the abuse and harassment they face as sex workers. She played a \r\nsignificant role in persuading the government to recognise <em>Hijras </em>as\r\n a third gender. Currently, she is working on the official definition of\r\n \"transgender\" in Bangladesh and trying to clear misconceptions held by \r\nwider society. What started out as a fight for trans rights for Joya, \r\nhas now grown to include all gender diverse and sexual identities.</p>\r\n<p>The nature and scope of feminist organising in contemporary \r\nBangladesh has changed. Organisations working on issues of gender rights\r\n are largely influenced by international donor organisations. Dependency\r\n on foreign funds means that local agendas and priorities are not given \r\nprecedence, with a focus on projectised organisational models as opposed\r\n to movement building.</p>\r\n<p>Bangladesh has had a rich history of feminist organising, as shown \r\nabove. Throughout our history, women have recognised and prioritised the\r\n same core feminist issues of choice, autonomy, and opportunity. While \r\nthis is not an exhaustive timeline by any means, it attempts to \r\ncontextualise the role of the organisations and individuals within the \r\ngreater feminist movement in Bangladesh. We hope the radical work of the\r\n women before us will help inspire new generations to join the fight.</p>', '', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 1, '2020-06-19 04:27:52'),

Geographically Rakhine state, where the current \r\nconflict is taking place, is separated from the rest of Myanmar by \r\nbarren mountain range. Ancient history gives the area its own separate \r\npast with a distinct Rakhine Kingdom being established in 1430 with its \r\ncapital in Mrauk U located as a link between Buddhist and Muslim Asia \r\nwith close ties with the Sultanate of Bengal. After 350 years of \r\nindependent existence Rakhine State was conquered by the Burmese in \r\n1784. This annexation was short lived as the territory was occupied by \r\nthe British in 1824 and made a part of the British Indian Empire. Today \r\nthe Rohingyas are about 1.1 million Muslim citizens of the Rakhine state\r\n but are not recognised legally as one of the 135 ethnic groups \r\nconstituting a part of the citizenry of Myanmar.</p><p>It is perhaps not just a coincidence that the current attack on the \r\nRohingyas follows on the heels of the report of the Rakhine Advisory \r\nCommission led by the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. This \r\nCommission was set up with active participation of the Myanmar \r\ngovernment, albeit under severe pressure from the international \r\ncommunity, and whose findings it had earlier pledged to implement. Now \r\nwith the latest spate of violence the prospect of implementation of the \r\nRakhine Commission appears remote and the possibility of a peaceful \r\nresolution of the Rohingya crisis may elude us once more.\r\n</p><p>The Commission has correctly identified the central questions to be \r\n“citizenship verification, documentation, rights and equality before the\r\n law” and goes on to say that “… if they are left to fester, the future \r\nof the Rakhine state-and indeed of Myanmar as a whole-will be \r\nirretrievably jeopardised.”</p>\r\n<p>As we see it from Bangladesh, it is not only the future of Myanmar \r\nwhich will be jeopardised but that of this region itself as the \r\nSecretary General of the UN warned last Wednesday (September 6) China, \r\ngiven its historical links, will take more than a passing interest in \r\nthis affair, an effort in which it will be supported by Russia the \r\nindications of which is discernible in their pattern of voting at the UN\r\n Security Council on recent resolutions on the Rohingya issue.</p>\r\n<p xss=removed><span xss=removed><span xss=removed>\"</span></span><span xss=removed><span xss=removed>Myanmar,\r\n on its part, must realise that blaming all the current atrocities on \r\nthe so-called terrorists and claiming that its security forces had \r\nnothing to do with the crimes committed, in spite of unvarying accounts \r\nof thousands of refugees to the contrary, is neither credible nor \r\nhelpful in solving the situation.</span></span>\r\n</p><p>The block of Arab and Muslim countries will naturally be drawn \r\ninto this fray as fellow Muslims are being slaughtered. Already there is\r\n sufficient reason for concern at the flow of Middle Eastern money in \r\nthe region with distinct fundamentalist overtones. We all know about \r\nRohingyas finding their way into various Arab and Muslim countries with \r\nstories of atrocities invoking a natural reaction for seeking justice \r\nand fighting a future of fear and intimidation by building up some sort \r\nof resistance including armed. These are but natural outcomes of \r\nprolonged oppression to which the Annan Report clearly alludes to.</p>\r\n<p>The US is likely to be more interested than usual given its \r\ndeteriorating relationship with both China and Russia and the rising \r\ntiff in the South China Sea, not to speak of tension with North Korea \r\nand its unpredictable and dangerous consequences.</p>\r\n<p>India has completely surprised Bangladesh by its all out endorsement \r\nof Myanmar\'s position. We, naively as it now appears, were hoping that \r\nPrime Minister Modi\'s visit to Myanmar would help, if not to solve issue\r\n but at least to stop the violence and ebb the flow of refugees. PM \r\nModi\'s support to the Myanmar\'s position and the absence of any \r\nsubstantive reference to the refugee issue and the consequent \r\nhumanitarian disaster has greatly disappointed Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>The rising terrorism that both Prime Minister Modi and the Aung San \r\nSuu Kyi have pledged to fight is created and sustained by oppression and\r\n ignoring the rights of a minority group. That has been the experience \r\neverywhere. For the so-called “Jihadists”, the oppression of the \r\nRohingyas fits the bill completely as a cause they will espouse to gain \r\ncredibility in the Muslim world whose natural support for this oppressed\r\n group of Muslims is only obvious.</p>\r\n<p>In this regard the emergence of ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army)\r\n is something that should concern all. In the early hours of August 25 \r\nthis group, whose Arabic name is Harakah al-Yaqin, simultaneously \r\nattacked 30 police posts and an army base in the northern side of the \r\nRakhine state. Twelve Myanmar troops and officials and 77 insurgents \r\nwere killed. This is by far the most audacious and damaging attack by \r\nthe insurgents who are mostly equipped with machetes, few small arms and\r\n hand held explosives. The emergence of such an armed group cannot be \r\nwelcomed by any country wanting peace and stability in this region.</p>\r\n<p>The International Crisis Group (ICG) termed this as the most serious \r\nescalation in the conflict. Obviously the biggest losers from the \r\nescalation and continuation of this conflict will be the two countries \r\ndirectly affected—Myanmar and Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>Bangladesh has not yet taken any hard-line against its only other \r\nneighbour save India and has tried, over the years to reach an \r\nunderstanding with Myanmar. It has internationalised the issue only to \r\nthe extent of seeking humanitarian aid and nothing more. It first \r\nreceived about 300,000 Rohingya refugees in 1978. Through negotiations \r\nabout 210,000 were repatriated with the rest continuing to live in \r\nBangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>However, the latest situation has changed everything. Bangladesh will\r\n now be under severe pressure from the Arab and Muslim world to \r\ninternationalise the issue and take a tougher stance than it has \r\nhitherto taken. The visits of the Indonesian and Turkish foreign \r\nministers are indications of that. If there is no change in the \r\nsituation on the ground Bangladesh will be left with little option but \r\nto take a more stringent approach that would further complicate the \r\nsituation.</p>\r\n<p>Myanmar, on its part, must realise that blaming all the current \r\natrocities on the so-called terrorists and claiming that its security \r\nforces had nothing to do with the crimes committed, in spite of \r\nunvarying accounts of thousands of refugees to the contrary, is neither \r\ncredible nor helpful in solving the situation.</p>\r\n<p>The Kofi Annan Commission has painstakingly worked out what \r\ninternational experts say to be a realistic path towards peaceful \r\nresolution of a conflict that left to itself may become a dangerous \r\ncrisis. Myanmar must pay heed to the recommendations of that report.</p>\r\n<p>Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar needs to remember what she \r\nherself said in her Nobel Prize acceptance speech that “Whenever \r\nsuffering is ignored, there will be seeds of conflict, for suffering \r\ndegrades and embitters and enrages”.</p>', '0', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 1, '2020-06-18 04:34:44'),

Photo: AFP', 'Is the future truly Asian?', '', '2020_05_23_5ec8a8ae96ae08', 8, '<p>To Parag Khanna, author of <em>The Future Is Asian,</em> the answer is almost self-evident.</p>\r\n<p>However, if you read his book carefully, you will find that he thinks\r\n global power will be shared between Asian and Western civilisations.</p>\r\n<p>For the west, the rise of Asia has been frighteningly fast, because \r\nas late as 1960, most of Asia was poor, agricultural and rural, with an \r\naverage income per capita of less than USD 1,000 in 2010 prices.</p>\r\n<p>But 50 years on, Asia has become more urban and industrialised, and \r\nis becoming a challenge to the west in terms of trade, income and \r\ninnovation.</p>\r\n<p>McKinsey has just published a study on<em> The Future Of Asia </em>that highlights many aspects about why Asia is both attractive to businessmen and yet feared as a competitor.</p>\r\n<p>Conventionally, excluding the Middle East and Iran, Asia is divided \r\ninto North-east Asia (China, Japan and South Korea), South-east Asia \r\n(mostly Asean), South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh) and Central \r\nAsia.</p>\r\n<p>But McKinsey has identified at least four Asias that are quite complementary to each other.</p>\r\n<p>First, there is Advanced Asia, comprising Australia, Japan, New \r\nZealand, South Korea and Singapore, each with per capita incomes \r\nexceeding USD 30,000, highly urbanised and rich, with a combined GDP \r\nthat is 10 percent of global GDP.</p>\r\n<p>This group provides technology, capital and market for the rest of Asia, but it is ageing fast.</p>\r\n<p>Second, China is the world’s largest trading economy, second largest \r\nin GDP after the US, and a growing consumer powerhouse. By 2030, the \r\nChinese consumer market will be equal to Western Europe and the US \r\ncombined.</p>\r\n<p>China is also an increasing capital provider to the rest of the world.</p>\r\n<p>Third, the 11 countries of Emerging Asia (Asean plus Bhutan and \r\nNepal, excluding Singapore) have young populations, fast growth and \r\ncultural diversity.</p>\r\n<p>Fourth, Frontier Asia and India—covering essentially South and \r\nCentral Asia including Afghanistan—which have 1.8 billion in population,\r\n still rural but young.</p>\r\n<p>Taken together, these four Asias today account for one-third of \r\nglobal GDP and 40 percent of the world’s middle class. But what is \r\nremarkable is that while the region grew from trading with the rest of \r\nthe world, intra-regional trade has grown faster, to 60 percent of total\r\n trade, with intra-regional foreign direct investment (FDI) at 66 \r\npercent of total inward FDI, and 74 percent of air traffic.</p>\r\n<p>Much of Asian growth will come from rapid urbanisation, amid growing \r\nconnectivity with each other. The top 20 cities in Asia will be mega \r\nconglomerates that are among the largest cities in the world with the \r\nfastest-growing income.</p>\r\n<p>A major finding is that America First-style protectionism is helping \r\nto intensify the localisation and regionalisation of intra-regional \r\nconnectivity in terms of trade, finance, knowledge and cultural \r\nnetworks. Furthermore, the traditional savings surpluses in Asia \r\nbasically went to London and New York and were recycled back in terms of\r\n foreign direct investment and portfolio flows.</p>\r\n<p>But no longer.</p>\r\n<p>Increasingly, Asian financial centres are emerging to compete to \r\nre-pump surplus capital from Advanced Asia and China to fund the growth \r\nin Emerging and Frontier Asia.</p>\r\n<p>In short, intra-regional finance is following intra-regional trade.</p>\r\n<p>In a multi-polar world, no one wants to be completely dependent on \r\nany single player but prefers network connectivity to other cities and \r\ncentres of activity and creativity.</p>\r\n<p>As Khanna puts it: “The phrase ‘China-led Asia’ is thus no more \r\nacceptable to most Asians than the notion of a ‘US-led West’ is to \r\nEuropeans.”</p>\r\n<p>But are such rosy growth prospects in Asia predestined or ordained?</p>\r\n<p>Based on the trajectory of demographic growth of half the world’s \r\nyoung population moving into middle income, the logical answer appears \r\nto be yes.</p>\r\n<p>But there are at least three major bumps in that trajectory.</p>\r\n<p>First, Asia, like the rest of the world, is highly vulnerable to global warming.</p>\r\n<p>Large populations with faster growth mean more energy consumption, \r\ncarbon emissions and natural resource degradation. Large chunks of Asia \r\nwill be vulnerable to more water, food and energy stresses, as well as \r\nnatural disasters (rising seas, forest fires, pandemics, typhoons etc).</p>\r\n<p>Second, even though more Asians have been lifted out of poverty, \r\ndomestic inequality of income and wealth has increased in the last 20 \r\nyears.</p>\r\n<p>Part of this is caused by rural-urban disparities, and widening gaps \r\nin high-value knowledge and skills. Without adequate social safety nets,\r\n healthcare and social security, dissatisfaction over youth \r\nunemployment, access to housing, and deafness to problems by \r\nbureaucracies has erupted in protests everywhere.</p>\r\n<p>Third, geopolitical rivalry has meant that there will be tensions in \r\ndiverse Asia over territorial, cultural and religious differences that \r\ncan rapidly escalate into conflict. The region is beginning to spend \r\nmore on armaments and defence, instead of focusing on alleviating \r\npoverty and addressing the common threat of climate change.</p>\r\n<p>Two generational leaders from the west have approached these threats from very different angles.</p>\r\n<p>Addressing the United Nations, Swedish schoolgirl Greta Thunberg \r\ndramatically shamed the older generation for its lack of action on \r\nclimate change. “People are suffering. People are dying. Entire \r\necosystems are collapsing. We are at the beginning of a mass extinction \r\nand all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic \r\ngrowth. How dare you,” she said.</p>\r\n<p>The young are idealistically appealing for unity in action against common fate.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, addressing the UN Security Council, US President Donald \r\nTrump was arguing the case for patriotism as a solution to global \r\nissues. Climate change was not mentioned at all.</p>\r\n<p>Since the older generation created most of the carbon emissions in \r\nthe first place, no wonder the young are asking why they are inheriting \r\nall the problems that the old deny.</p>\r\n<p>This then is the difference in passion between generations.</p>\r\n<p>Globalisation occurred because of increasing flows of trade, finance,\r\n data and people. That is not stoppable by patriot-protected borders.</p>\r\n<p>A multi-polar Asia within a multi-polar world means that even America\r\n First, however strong, will have to work with everyone, despite \r\ndifferences in worldviews.</p>\r\n<p>All patriots will have to remember that it is the richness of diversity that keeps the world in balance.</p>\r\n<p>Andrew Sheng is an honorary adviser with the CIMB Asean Research \r\nInstitute and a distinguished fellow with the Asia Global Institute at \r\nthe University of Hong Kong.

Indeed, a cross-civilisation \r\nperspective better reflects the new dimension of China-Europe relations \r\nin recent years.</p>\r\n<p>China and Europe are considered “two major civilisations”, as well as\r\n “two major markets” and “two major forces” in the world today. \r\nAccording to China’s Policy Paper on the European Union published late \r\nlast year, the third of its kind since 2003, it is imperative to uphold \r\ninter-civilisation dialogue to facilitate mutual learning.</p>\r\n<p>Such an attitude has proved to be increasingly important for meeting \r\nthe challenges facing the international community. In a world undergoing\r\n unprecedented changes, it’s mandatory to reaffirm the convergence \r\nbetween rather than the clash of civilisations. Still, the matter hinges\r\n on the west’s relations with other civilisations and cultures. As the \r\ncentres of eastern and western civilisations, China and Europe are \r\nexpected to set an example for promoting cultural exchanges across the \r\nworld at large.</p>\r\n<p>Since the Industrial Revolution, Europe and its younger extension \r\nacross the Atlantic have been the dominating forces in the world. \r\nHowever, the rise of emerging economies over the past decades has \r\nsomewhat reduced the west’s relative weight in global affairs, \r\neconomically and otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>The 21st century has been driven by not only multilateralism but also\r\n multi-conceptualism. In a global village where the advancement of \r\ntransportation and communication has reduced geographic distances, \r\neconomies continue to interact while civilisations and cultures continue\r\n to coexist, or live together, as part of a biosystem, to borrow a \r\nconcept put forth by 19th century German biologist Henrich Anton de \r\nBary.</p>\r\n<p>The west and the east have had significant intellectual encounters in\r\n the previous century. The interactions between Martin Heidegger and \r\nKuki Shuzo or Tesuka Tomio, the dialogue between Arnold Toynbee and \r\nDaisaku Ikeda, and the conversations between Carl Gustav Jung and Ezra \r\nPound are references for cross-cultural exchanges.</p>\r\n<p>It’s true that conflicts between the east and west have occurred. \r\nThere were the tragedies brought about by colonial and imperial \r\ninvasions of countries and the oppression of people living in the \r\ncolonies that resulted from these invasions. There was the military \r\nconfrontation in the Pacific that ended with the use of the atomic bombs\r\n in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending one of the darkest chapters in human \r\nhistory. But the deeper roots of those destructions can be traced to \r\n19th century western nationalism and the rivalries among the European \r\npowers, which eventually led to the two world wars.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, a renewed serious intercultural dialogue between the west \r\nand the east, China in particular, would reveal there are profound \r\nelements of convergence between different traditions which, contrary to \r\nwhat Samuel Huntington suggests, are not destined to clash.</p>\r\n<p>Take China and Europe for example. The cultural compatibility is \r\nexplained, to a certain extent, by the fact that both civilisations are,\r\n above all, humanistic. They have evolved under different forms, but \r\nboth essentially put the dignity of man at the centre of their \r\npreoccupations, a dignity nurtured by objective social mechanisms and \r\nself-cultivation.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond recurrent discourse on Sino-western strategic rivalries or \r\ndebates on the possibility of a modern-day “Thucydides trap”, the real \r\npattern that a long-term view of history shows is that of a surprising \r\ncompatibility between Chinese and western civilisations.</p>\r\n<p>Matteo Ricci, who interestingly is better remembered by China than \r\nEurope, was able to articulate Confucianism and some of the key \r\nprinciples of Christianity by using their connection in relation to the \r\ndignity of man. The principle of accommodation wisely put into practice \r\nby the Jesuits would have been less easy to implement had there been \r\ngreater cultural estrangement separating the two traditions.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the notion of an “Axial Age” would not have been conceptualised\r\n by Karl Jaspers had there been no commonality between the Zhou Dynasty \r\n(c.11th century-256 BC) and Greco-Roman Europe. And French litterateur \r\nRené Etiemble would not have presented in <em>L’Europe Chinoise</em> \r\n(1988) the deep impact that Chinese culture had on 18th-century France. \r\nThere is, indeed, a relative conceptual alignment between the secularism\r\n of western modernity and the immanence of Confucian ethics.</p>\r\n<p>It is undeniable that there is a certain degree of closeness between \r\neastern and western traditions. The echoes of the ancient Silk Road \r\nstill deafen, not because it describes material transactions along the \r\nroutes crisscrossing Eurasia, but because it is a powerful metaphor for \r\ncross-fertilisation between the west and east beyond the passage of \r\ntime.</p>\r\n<p>British philosopher and historian Isaiah Berlin has said all racial \r\nor ethnic conflicts arise from the pursuit of a monistic world. The \r\nmansion of a civilisation needs to have windows, or it will not only \r\nmiss all the good views outside, but also suffocate to self-destruction.\r\n An expression used by Chinese anthropologist Fei Xiaotong indicates a \r\nhigher level of wisdom. An acceptable rendering into the English \r\nlanguage of Fei’s insight could be: Appreciate one’s own beauty and \r\nthose of others, so they can coexist and harmony can prevail.</p>\r\n<p>As one of the dimensions of a global network connecting \r\ncivilisations, relations between the west and China are of great \r\nimportance.

This is the message that has gone viral in the \r\nlast month or so after the covid-19 situation worsened globally, with \r\nthe number of infected people increasing at an exponential rate. Staying\r\n at home and maintaining social distance has helped curb the outbreak \r\nand isolation is essential to control the pandemic. However, isolation \r\nis also a crucial element for domestic violence, with abusers often \r\nresorting to this tactic to control their victims. While recent articles\r\n in Bangladesh have stressed the importance of gender-based violence, a \r\ndeeper understanding of the root causes and legal definition of domestic\r\n violence is required to successfully protect its victims.\r\n</p><p>Domestic violence is not new in Bangladesh. There have been \r\ninnumerable incidents of such violence before the outbreak of covid-19 \r\nand unfortunately such incidents would perhaps continue even after the \r\npandemic is over. It is deeply rooted in our society with patriarchy \r\nendorsing and reinforcing such abuse. Research has found that in both \r\nrural and urban areas of Bangladesh, social norms and practices have \r\ninternalised domestic violence. Victims are often sent back from their \r\nnatal homes to their abusive husband as it impacts the \'\'<em>shamman</em>\"\r\n or honour of her family. This is a scenario that we are all too \r\nfamiliar with, and it has led to fatal results for some of these \r\nvictims. Thus, women are taught to be tolerant and overlook abuse in a \r\nrelationship, after all it was \'<em>just a slap\'</em>. Such are the \r\nnarratives of domestic violence in Bangladesh and women are often \r\nunaware that such violence is fundamentally and legally wrong with \r\ncommunity attitudes also condoning such practices.</p>\r\n<p>Evidence from around the world suggests that domestic violence \r\nincreases in times of crisis, and mandatory lockdowns. Women and \r\nchildren are more vulnerable to abuse by partners and family members and\r\n are isolated from people and resources that could help them out. This \r\nbrings us to the crux of the matter: what do we mean by domestic \r\nviolence from a legal perspective in Bangladesh? A common misconception \r\nin our country is that it is counted as domestic violence only if the \r\nhusband beats/hits the wife, i.e. physical violence. However, physical \r\nviolence is only one of the four types of domestic violence. As per \r\nsection 3 of the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2010 \r\ndomestic violence includes physical, psychological, sexual and economic \r\nabuse against a woman or a child (the victim) by someone in the family \r\nor someone with whom they are in a family relationship. Physical \r\nviolence includes (but is not limited to) slapping, hitting, beating, \r\nkicking the victim, etc. Moreover, an increasingly common yet grossly \r\nunderreported form of domestic violence is psychological abuse, which \r\nincludes insults, humiliation, etc. for example telling a woman she is \r\nworthless, not good enough for that person, is ugly or threatening the \r\nvictim in any way. Furthermore, domestic violence also includes \r\ncontrolling behavior such as not allowing the victim to meet her family \r\nor her friends thereby isolating her, controlling her movements and \r\ndepriving the victim of her independence. Sexual abuse includes abuse of\r\n a sexual nature violating the dignity of the victim. However, this is a\r\n tricky area if the victim is raped by her husband, as Bangladesh does \r\nnot criminalise marital rape unless the wife is under thirteen years of \r\nage. The fourth form of abuse is deprivation of economic resources which\r\n includes depriving the victim of property which to they are legally \r\nentitled; depriving the victims of daily necessities, etc. It is \r\npertinent to note that domestic violence is not just spousal violence, \r\nit can also be abuse on a woman or child by any family member (for \r\nexample abuse by mother/father in-laws on their daughter-in-law, abuse \r\non a child by any member of the family).</p>\r\n<p>During these uncertain times when we are all forced to stay home, it \r\nis an unfortunate reality that gender-based violence is magnifying in \r\nevery corner of the world. In a country like Bangladesh where \r\ninstitutions such as courts are closed for an extended period, a \r\nperson\'s right to a fair trial may be affected and may even prevent the \r\nvictims from seeking legal help due to this crisis. However, all is not \r\nlost and victims of domestic abuse can call or send a text message to \r\n109, a 24-hour toll-free helpline for violence against women and \r\nchildren for counseling/advise or they can also call the 24-hour \r\nemergency helpline 999. For those of us at home, if we know any family \r\nmember, friend, neighbour is a victim of domestic abuse of any kind, \r\neven in the time of social distancing we need to look out for one \r\nanother. This can be done by checking up on them via voice or video \r\ncalls. Lastly, it is also extremely important that governments around \r\nthe world, particularly the Government of Bangladesh along with the NGOs\r\n working in this sector do not lose sight of such human rights \r\nviolations. The wellbeing of the citizens must be kept in mind as they \r\ntry to combat the pandemic and decide how and where to allocate \r\nresources.</p>', '', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', 'The Daily Star', 1, 0, 3, '2020-07-24 10:38:29'),

The proviso states that such \r\nlaid off workers\' names have to be borne on the muster-rolls of the \r\nestablishment and he has to be someone who has completed not less than \r\none year of continuous service under the employer that undertakes the \r\nlay-off.</p>\r\n<p>According to the same section, the amount of compensation shall be \r\nequal to half of the total of the basic wages and dearness allowance, \r\nand ad-hoc or interim pay, if any, and the full amount of housing \r\nallowance, if any. Basically, the quantum of the compensation would be \r\nhalf of what would have been payable to him had he not been laid-off as \r\nsuch. Even a <em>badli </em>worker will enjoy this compensation provided\r\n his name is on the muster-rolls of and provided he has completed one \r\nyear of continuous service in the establishment.</p>\r\n<p>Section 17 says that despite the layoffs, the employer shall maintain\r\n a muster-roll, and provide for the making of entries therein by or for \r\nthe laid-off workers who may present themselves for work at the \r\nestablishment at the appointed time during normal working hours.</p>\r\n<p>Section 16(4) clarifies that compensation shall not be paid to a laid\r\n off worker for an indefinite period. It says that unless there is an \r\nagreement between the worker and the employer to the contrary, no worker\r\n shall be entitled to the payment of compensation under this section for\r\n more than forty-five days during a calendar year.</p>\r\n<p>However, Section 16(5) considers the welfare of the worker. It says \r\nthat regardless of whatever section 16(4) says, if during a calendar \r\nyear a worker is laid-off for more than forty-five days, either \r\ncontinuously or intermittently, and the lay off after the expiry of the \r\nfirst forty-five days comprises period or periods of fifteen days or \r\nmore, then the worker shall, unless there is an agreement to the \r\ncontrary between the worker and the employer, be paid compensation for \r\nall the days comprised in every subsequent period of lay-off for fifteen\r\n days or more. This amount of compensation shall be equal to one-fourth \r\nof the total of the basic wages and dearness allowance, and ad-hoc or \r\ninterim pay, if any, and the full amount of housing allowance, if any.</p>\r\n<p>Section 16(7), however says that in any case where, during a calendar\r\n year, a worker is to be laid off after the first forty-five days, for \r\nany continuous period of fifteen days or more, the employer may, instead\r\n of laying off such a worker, retrench him under section 20.</p>\r\n<p>There are certain cases in which laid off workers shall not be \r\nentitled to compensation. One of such grounds, according to Section 18, \r\nis when a laid off worker refuses to accept on the same wages, an \r\nalternative employment not requiring any special skill or previous \r\nexperience, in the same establishment by which he has been laid-off, or \r\nin any other establishment belonging to the same employer and situated \r\nin the same town or village or within a radius of eight kilometers from \r\nthe establishment.</p>\r\n<p>Section 20 provides that a worker being in continuous service under \r\nthe employer for one year or more, may be retrenched.  However, in order\r\n to do that, the worker has to be given one month\'s notice in writing, \r\nindicating the reasons for retrenchment. In lieu of such notice, the \r\nworker has to be paid wages for the period of notice. Furthermore, a \r\nretrenched worker as such has to be duly paid compensation, equivalent \r\nto thirty days\' wages or gratuity for every completed year of service if\r\n any, whichever is higher.</p>\r\n<p>However, the law is different for a retrenched worker who undergoes \r\nretrenchment under Section 16(7). For a worker retrenched under section \r\n16 (7) as a laid off worker, no notice as mentioned in sub-section (2) \r\n(a) shall be necessary. The worker shall be paid fifteen days wages in \r\naddition to the compensation or gratuity, as the case may be, which may \r\nbe payable to him under sub-section (2) (c).</p>\r\n<p>Section 21 deals with the issue of re-employment of retrenched \r\nworkers. It states that where any number of workers are retrenched, and \r\nthe employer proposes to take into his employ any worker within a period\r\n of one year from the date of such retrenchment, he shall give an \r\nopportunity to the retrenched workers belonging to the particular \r\ncategory concerned by sending a notice to their last known addresses, to\r\n offer themselves for employment.

I used to write mostly when I was in school \r\nand college, and some of the poems I wrote then were even published. \r\nNow, I\'m very busy with other things, so I had to take a break from \r\npoetry. But, after the murder of George Floyd, like a lot of people, it \r\naffected me, and I decided to turn my feelings into words again and \r\nwrote a piece about it. I read it to my daughter and wife, and they both\r\n seemed to like it. So, I recorded it and uploaded it online, and it got\r\n a lot of positive feedback. A lot of people from both here and abroad \r\ncalled me to say that they really loved it. However, just because I \r\nwrote this piece doesn\'t automatically mean that I am a poet and I am \r\ngoing to be writing regularly.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: If there are more events in the future that really affect you, will you be writing poetry about those?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>I once saw a picture of a child \r\nwho was injured in an accident, and the child\'s family was running from \r\none hospital to another searching for treatment. Unfortunately, that \r\nchild did not survive. After reading about that story, I felt very sad, \r\nand I wrote a piece about that. However, I never published that piece. \r\nSo, if an event occurs that makes me feel emotional, I will write about \r\nit.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: What made you start reciting poetry?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>It started when I was in school. \r\nWe had many competitions for reciting poetry, and I took part in them. \r\nMy parents were both teachers, so even at home, I would recite poetry. \r\nWhen I used to read, my father would help me with my pronunciation, and \r\nthat helped me. My father was also very adept at recitation.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: How did you start doing it professionally?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>When I came to Dhaka in 1968, \r\npeople were protesting the Pakistani government. It was around October, \r\nand most Awami League leaders were in jail or hiding. So, the students \r\nwere protesting a lot. I was involved in the protests, and I think that I\r\n am very fortunate as I got to see history unfold in front of my eyes. \r\nBack then, I was involved in theatre, but mainly in an organisational \r\nrole. The <em>Motia Group</em> had a cultural platform, and we used to \r\norganise a lot of plays there. Not many plays would be held back then, \r\nso we would bring in students, teachers and even office workers who \r\nwould do plays and have them perform. Syed Hasan Imam would direct most \r\nof our projects. People like Golam Mostofa, Anwar Hossain, Abul Hayat, \r\nLucky Enam and many other famous names were involved with us. Back then,\r\n I would do whatever job I was required to do. I would be the prompter, I\r\n would arrange tea for everyone, and sometimes I would do some small \r\nroles. That was my experience of theatre before the independence. In \r\n1972, I was made a narrator for a musical directed by Abul Hasnat. I \r\nreceived a lot of praise for that, and that\'s how it started for me.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: After this pandemic is over, do you think that we will all be more humane?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>I see that a lot of young people \r\nare standing beside others to help, and I think that they won\'t stop \r\ndoing so after this pandemic is over. I also believe that now, we will \r\nsee people be more empathetic towards others and help make things easier\r\n for other people.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: You have always had a very iconic beard. Tell me, what inspired you to grow a beard?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>After the liberation of \r\nBangladesh, I joined the Press Information Department as the press \r\nrelation officer, but I also had to do translations. Back then, I used \r\nto live in Bakshibazar, and the office was in Dhanmondi. It took me a \r\ncouple of hours to reach the office. So, I had to wake up at six in the \r\nmorning and leave the house by seven. In one hour, I had to shave, get \r\nready and make my breakfast. It was very difficult for me, so I decided \r\nto reduce one task and started to grow my beard. After that, everyone \r\ntold me that the beard suited me, so I kept it. However, after I started\r\n acting, many people questioned how I can play different roles with this\r\n beard. To that, I always said that people from all walks of life in \r\nBangladesh sport beards, so I don\'t see why it would be a problem for me\r\n to have a beard.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Rafi Hossain: How did your friendship with Humayun Ahmed start?</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Asaduzzaman Noor: </strong>He appreciated my acting, and we \r\nbonded while doing dramas.

According to the statistics, since 1971 till \r\ndate, around 33 cyclones have hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh and \r\nfrom 1797 to 2020, in the last 223 years, a total of 78 cyclones have \r\nhit the coastal areas. Apparently, till 1960, there were only 30 \r\ncyclones whereas from 1960 to 2020, only in last 40 years there were 48 \r\ncyclones. In the last one year, three cyclones, Foni, Bulbul and Amphan \r\nhave hit the coastal areas. The research suggests that the onus for the \r\nincrease in more powerful and regular cyclones is owed to the hike in \r\ntemperatures. Currently, the temperature above the Bay of Bengal is 31 \r\ndegrees, whereas in 2007 it was 28.7 degrees; thus, the increase in \r\ntemperature has been 2.7 degrees.</p>\r\n<p>With the prevalence of natural calamities caused due to global \r\nwarming, environmentalists have emphasised on adhering to the Paris \r\nAgreement, as both developed and developing countries alike are required\r\n to limit their emissions. Its central aim is to strengthen the global \r\nresponse to the threat of climate change by curbing temperature rise \r\nbelow 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue \r\nefforts to limit the temperature increase even further 1.5 degrees \r\nCelsius. The Agreement requires all parties to put forward their efforts\r\n through nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This includes \r\nrequirements that all parties report regularly on their emissions and on\r\n their implementation efforts.</p>\r\n<p>On this occasion, Bangladesh has received much appreciation as it has\r\n been one of the earliest countries to prepare and submit the NDC to \r\nUNFCC, in 2015. Bangladesh committed to reduce its Green House Gas \r\nemissions by 5?low \'business-as-usual\' level by 2030 using only \r\ndomestic resources and this reduction level may be extended up to 15% if\r\n sufficient external fund is received. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has \r\nbeen announced as one of the winners of the United Nations Champions of \r\nthe Earth award in recognition of her country\'s initiatives to address \r\nclimate change. Bangladesh is also the first country to set up its own \r\nClimate Change Trust Fund. In addition, the Bangladesh Constitution was \r\namended in 2011 to include a constitutional directive to the State to \r\nprotect the environment and natural resources for current and future \r\ngenerations. However, it is also criticised that the emissions reduction\r\n target of 5% looks very insignificant compared to the 30-35% reduction \r\nplan taken by India. Many other developing nations have also set greater\r\n reduction targets than Bangladesh.</p>\r\n<p>Whilst the Paris Agreement does not legally bind its parties in terms\r\n of submitting their NDC, the parties are, however, legally bound to \r\nhave their progress tracked by technical experts to assess achievement \r\ntoward the NDC. Nevertheless, the inactiveness of several developed \r\nnations is still evident. As of February 2020, the only significant \r\nemitters which are not parties are Iran and Turkey. In 2017, President \r\nDonald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the Agreement and\r\n subsequently initiated the formal withdrawal process.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to comprehend, the reasons behind reluctance among \r\nstates, in abiding by the agreement and taking pro-active actions to \r\nprevent the disastrous environmental consequences. The primary sources \r\nof international law are international agreements, custom and general \r\nprinciples of law. In case no explicit agreement exists, one must look \r\nto customary rules and general principles of international law. \r\nNevertheless, it is both difficult to obtain a consensus concerning \r\ncustomary norms and also when accused of violating a customary norm, a \r\nstate may claim that no such norm exists or that it never accepted the \r\nnorm and therefore is not bound by it. Furthermore, states often defend \r\ntheir sovereignty because they consider their physical integrity and \r\ncontinued political identity as important elements in their foreign \r\npolicies. The option to withdraw undermines the purpose of any \r\nagreement.</p>\r\n<p>The predominant sources of the law governing creation of \r\ninternational agreements are the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties and the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties Between States\r\n and International Organisations or Between International Organisations \r\n1986. However, the Vienna Conventions do not stipulate any particular \r\nratification process nor do they require any action to comply with the \r\nagreement during the ratification process. Thus, the delay in \r\nratification of a treaty in the case of environmental agreements may \r\nrender the agreement useless if the underlying environmental situation \r\nworsens or becomes irreversible.</p>\r\n<p>One of the major hurdles in implementing treaty law to environmental \r\nproblems is its limited utility until a large number of states ratify \r\nthe treaty; further, they lack enforcement mechanisms that encourage \r\ncompliance with the treaty. Hence, in the absence of cooperation and \r\nenforcement, the environment will continue to degenerate.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Nevertheless, the situation is not all \'dull and grim\', after decades\r\n of effort by environmentalists and affected countries like Bangladesh, \r\nnations today have set a concrete goal to tackle temperature rise. \r\nFurthermore, it can be expected that the ever-growing climate movements \r\nhappening worldwide will have a constructive impact, consequently, \r\ncompelling the reluctant nations to abide by their commitments under \r\nthese environmental treaties. By all means, it is inevitable that \r\ninternational matters concerning the environment is dealt with in \r\n\'cooperation\' by all nations.<br></p></div><br>', '0', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', '', 1, 0, 11, '2020-07-12 04:21:32'),
(78, 'blank_news.png', '', 'Covid-19 and Rights of the healthcare workers', '', '2020_07_12_5f0a8ff30aeda13', 13, '<p>Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the heart of the current crisis that\r\n the whole world is undergoing. Due to the spread of coronavirus, while \r\nall offices, services are closed or nearly closed, one institution \r\nacross the world never closed for a moment is the hospital. Physicians, \r\nnurses, cleaning staffs – all the frontline fighters are working \r\nday-night restlessly. In Bangladesh, insufficiency of infrastructure, \r\nlack of quality medical equipment, diagnosis machinery, and geographic \r\nmal-distribution of Human Resource for Health (HRH) are some common \r\nissues which we have been grappling with for a long time. Due to lack of\r\n administrative preparation, Bangladesh is now paying the cost of this \r\npandemic as the frontline fighters are also getting infected by this \r\nvirus. According to the report of Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA), a\r\n total of forty-one doctors lost the battle against the deadly virus in \r\nthe country. So far, around 1040 doctors, 901 nurses and 1360 staffs \r\nhave been tested Covid-19 positive.</p>\r\n<p>The rapid loss of senior doctors of the country is an irreparable \r\nloss for the health sector. Right to life and right to health as \r\nenshrined in Articles 32 and 18(1) of the Constitution respectively, are\r\n equally applicable to HCWs. If we cannot protect them, we run the risk \r\nof losing our ability to control the virus. According to the WHO, \r\ncurrently the doctor-patient ratio in Bangladesh is 5.81 per 10,000 \r\npeople, which places the country at the second position from the bottom \r\nin South Asia. Comparing with countries like Austria (51.44), Finland \r\n(38.12) and France (32.67), is an absolute luxury for us. Since the \r\ncountry is already suffering from a shortage of HRH, can the country \r\nreally afford losing more doctors?</p>\r\n<p>Since the social transmission of Covid-19 has already started, the \r\nHCWs are facing multifarious problems. Firstly, at the early stage of \r\nthe pandemic, lack of testing facilities and unavailability of Personal \r\nProtective Equipment (PPE) has resulted in doctors to expose directly to\r\n this life-threatening virus. Moreover, concealing information or \r\nmisinformation on symptoms by a significant number of patients resulted \r\nin the transmission of the virus to the HCWs. Secondly, social \r\nharassment by their landlord to leave the house in fear of virus \r\ninfection. Thirdly, being blamed by patients, attendants for not \r\nproviding medical equipment such as oxygen tubes and ventilation even if\r\n they are not responsible for the supply of these equipment and \r\ntechnical services. Fourthly, facing the allegation of denial of \r\ntreatment to patients. However, in reality, without any safety gear, \r\ndoctors and nurses are in no position to treat infected patients. \r\nFifthly, working under extreme pressure, fear, lack of familiarity with \r\nPPE use and disposal, inappropriate working hours, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>In this unprecedented period, while doctors are performing heroic \r\ntasks, one senior doctor, Dr. Abdur Rakib Khan from Khulna was beaten to\r\n death by a patient\'s family members on allegation of wrong treatment of\r\n pregnant woman causing her death. Evidently, the doctor-patient \r\nrelationship in Bangladesh has reached rock bottom level and their \r\nrights in question.</p>\r\n<p>To protect the HCWs against violence, very recently, India has \r\npromulgated the Epidemic Diseases (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020, which \r\namends century old the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This amendment makes\r\n \'act of violence\' against the HCWs, including doctors and nurses, \r\npunishable with three months to five years imprisonment with a fine of \r\n₹50,000 to ₹2,00,000. For grievous injury, imprisonment term can be \r\nextended up to 7 years. Last year, China enacted its first comprehensive\r\n law on basic medical and healthcare, after a female doctor stabbed to \r\ndeath in Beijing. Article 57 of this Act prohibits any individual and \r\norganisation from threatening, harming the personal security of medical \r\nstaff, or violating their dignity.</p>\r\n<p>The government of Bangladesh has taken several positive measures to \r\ncope with the current crisis. On 7 April 2020, Prime Minister Sheikh \r\nHasina announced special insurance and stimulus for the HCWs and other \r\nemployees of the republic for their frontline roles in the fight against\r\n coronavirus. Special incentives include health insurance of Tk 5-10 \r\nlakh (according to rank), and the amount will be five times higher if \r\nanyone is at higher risk of death or dies from the virus. Also, the \r\ngovernment will bear the treatment cost of frontline medical staff \r\ncontracting the virus while on duty. The respective total amounts are \r\nTk. 100 crore for medical staff treating Covid-19 patients, and Tk. 750 \r\ncrore for life insurance. The Anti-Corruption Commission has sent out a \r\nwarning to landlords against giving eviction notice to the HCWs. Various\r\n private entities have also come forward to build hospitals, supplying \r\nprotective equipment.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Despite all these, a few more steps must be taken to protect the \r\nrights of the HCWs. The allocation of budget for health sector should be\r\n increased remarkably to ensure the safety of the HCWs. For the security\r\n of the HCWs, appropriate laws must be applied in consulting with \r\nprofessionals working in this sector to protect them against violence. \r\nAfter all, nothing can justify hostility against the very people who are\r\n our first line of defence in this pandemic.</p></div><br>', '0', 'Codeigniter,Bootstrap4,SEO', 1, '', '', 1, 0, 12, '2020-07-12 04:22:11'),
